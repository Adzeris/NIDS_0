# NIDS — Network Intrusion Detection System

A Python-based Network Intrusion Detection System that monitors network traffic in real time and blocks malicious activity using iptables.

## What It Does

This program watches your network interface for common attacks and automatically blocks the attacker's IP or MAC address. It has four detection modules:

- **Port Scan Detector** — Catches TCP SYN scans (like nmap) by tracking how many unique ports a single IP hits in a short time window. Uses Scapy for packet sniffing.
- **Brute-Force Detector** — Monitors SSH login attempts through system logs (journalctl). If someone fails too many times in a row, they get blocked.
- **DoS Detector** — Samples ICMP traffic using tcpdump and blocks any source flooding you with ping requests above a threshold.
- **Spoof Detector** — Detects ARP spoofing (MitM attacks), bogon/fake source IPs, and TTL anomalies that suggest someone is intercepting traffic.

There is also a **MAC Address Filter** that supports whitelist and blacklist modes, and a detected MAC review system where blocked MACs are saved for you to decide what to do with them later.

## How It Works

- Each module runs in its own thread
- Blocking is done through custom iptables chains (`NIDS_BLOCK`, `NIDS_SPOOF`, `NIDS_MAC`)
- All settings (thresholds, enabled modules, interface, etc.) are saved in `nids_config.json`
- Logs are saved to the `logs/` folder with timestamps

## Requirements

- Python 3
- PyQt5
- Scapy
- Linux with iptables
- Root privileges (needed for packet capture and firewall rules)

## How to Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run with the launcher (auto-elevates to root)
./nids.sh

# Or run directly
sudo python3 gui.py
```

## GUI

The GUI has four tabs:

- **Live Monitor** — Shows real-time alerts, blocks, and system messages
- **Configuration** — Set the network interface, enable/disable modules, and adjust detection thresholds
- **MAC Filter** — Manage allowed/blocked MAC addresses and review detected MACs
- **About** — Basic info about the program
